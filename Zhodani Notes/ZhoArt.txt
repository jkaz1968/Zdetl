Discussion from 9/17/22 - Art and public spaces

Art as an impermanent creation - 
Aboriginal dream time - Everywhen, a concept that all points in time are connected metaphysically
How long would a work of art remain in place before being altered in some way?
Social rules define who and how art can be changed 
Mind-healers could use art therapy to enhance their work and help patients
Art for art's sake, art for communication, art for personal expression
Types of art - visual arts, music, performance art
The artistic aspects of mechanical and user interface design
Does Zhdantia art include depictions of people and animals?
- possibly; with 6000 worlds there will be a lot of diversity
- people and critters appear as representational aspects/archetypes instead of literal depictions
