
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the 
ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit 
down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. 

(Formal Zdetl):
Hole-Ground-within within-dwelt-hobbit.
