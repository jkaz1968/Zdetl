The Teqozdievl - what are they, how do they work, what's their function in society?
History - 
I think the Teqozdievl never had anything to do with contests themselves; I lean towards it being instituted solely to select the most useful and innovative Psions available for tasks in government, the military, and to serve the Nobles in their endeavors. Probably the latter at first.

The power of the early post-Dzaqtlas Noble Houses relied heavily on having the most capable Psions they could find, and engaging them in contests with one another the most efficient way to 'train the force' and also select the best from among them for particular service to the House.

Soon, each Noble House might send out its 'champions' to duel informally and then more formally- whether in 'battle' or just contests of skills- as a way to settle disputes without mobilizing expensive troops.

The games are both competitive and cooperative, 
Good topic. I think we Baz call them 'Games' because as an activity they just don't resemble anything else in 3I culture.
You sent
Yeah, the word Teqozdievl I almost untranslatable.
You sent
Dievl can mean thoughts, psionics, or almost anything to do with the mind….
John
John Waterman
Rather than trying to frame them in 3I terms as 'Games', we should discuss what part the Teqozdievl plays in Zhadantia society and what it means to each part of it. Even traditional things still have a function, though the original reason for them may have been forgotten or retooled for modern needs.
John
John Waterman
It's definitely not a mandatory 'charismatic contest'- a form of dominance control- like most sporting events in 3I (and its earlier) cultures.
You sent
Oh definitely not - entry is purely by choice, not compulsory. You can enter only once, ever, and there’s prestige just for being there.
John
So there's that, but it's personal, local and transitory prestige. Not DZ wide or historical prestige.
John
John Waterman
No one is making statues of you if you 'win'. And what exactly does 'winning' mean?
You sent
More responsibility.
John
John Waterman
Yay! Definitely NOT a 3I style competition, then . . .
5:48 PM
You sent
Oh, no. It’s almost a cross between the Hajj and the Super Bowl.
John
John Waterman
Good way to put it . . .so, just one, on Zhdant, every 3 local years. No regionals?
You sent
No one enters without knowing what they’re signing up for it the win. And no one enter’s casually; you only do it if and when you feel ready.
You sent
The winners demonstrate both power and control, and the ability to lead.
You sent
Might be regional or local contests, but mostly the preparation is actually doing one’s job…
John
John Waterman
If it's only ever held on Zhdant, it seems like those who live on or close to the Homeworld have a sort of advantage . . .
You sent
Not necessarily. You only get one shot at it, so there’s strong incentive to practice well, and take it seriously.
You sent
Since it could take months for competitors to make the trip, planning is critical.
John
John Waterman
Intendants only, right? Someone has to sponsor you, at least to the extent of arranging your travel. Is that a Noble, or some organization in the gov't?
You sent
Yep, intendants only, and with the approval of your Noble patron.
You sent
So everyone is there for a reason.
John
John Waterman
Who decides who makes the cut? There has to be a maximum number of competitors . . .
You sent
Ooh, that’s not clear.
John
John Waterman
I mean, the potential pool is ENORMOUS.
You sent
Some multiple of three…
You sent
How about 300?
You sent
It’s not all individual contests either; there are team events as well.
John
Okay, the DZ in the 12th Century Imperial is about 7 trillion. One of six of them has Talent. Every 'year', assuming a population growth rate of 0.1%, about a BILLION new Intendants 'arrive' in the population every year . . .
John
. . .obviously, only a tiny fraction of them are going to get 'sponsored' for the contest, but that's still PLENTY.
John
John Waterman
300 seems arbitrarily SMALL.
You sent
True. On the other hand, sponsorship is never guaranteed, and entry is by choice. An Intendant won’t even ASK unless they think there’s a chance of getting the sponsorship and making the first round cut.
John
John Waterman
So there IS a selection process . . .okay, there'd HAVE to be, but how much of that process happens on Zhdant and how much off-world? Contests on each local world, sub-sector, sector, etc? Leading up to the Bigs on the Homeworld?
You sent
But it does imply there’s a selection process at the local level, or the field would get crowded very fast.
John
John Waterman
Oh yeah. 300 is too small, but a million would be hard to handle even on Zhdant. It's be a significant fraction of the passenger traffic capacity available in the DZ.
You sent
If the competitors are chosen from the ranks of regional winners, then those who make it to Zhdant are literally the best of the best.
You sent
These are not casual practitioners; they’re artisans, performers, scientists, and other professionals who have been specifically chosen as the future leaders.
John
John Waterman
So even those who 'lose' on Zhdant are five-star Psions.
You sent
I find it hard to believe there’s only ONE winner out of the entire field of 300, 3000, or whatever.
John
Yeah, there's a LOT to explore here. I just wanted to float some numbers, find out what makes sense and what would be improbable.
John
John Waterman
We can discuss what the structure of the competition is like- what constitues 'winning' or 'success'; is it a measure against some traditional standard or rules for each event; are 'new' techniques showcased; how teams operate; etc.
You sent
Excellent.
You sent
It’s not just a tool for elevating someone to nobility; it’s how their society grows and evolves.
John
John Waterman
It could be a very traditional and highly structured event, rife with symbolic meaning, or a place where the 'avant gard' is showcased and new techniques revealed to the cognoscenti.
You sent
The nobility aren’t just watching - they’re taking notes.
John
John Waterman
Oh, for sure- these 'kids' are destined for greatness. If you get to Zhdant, your UCP is 'FFFFFA'.
John
John Waterman
Is there a component of physical danger in any of the contests? Or even peril?
You sent
Well, if you don’t get your TK defenses up in time to stop that discus…
You sent
Injuries probably do happen.
John
John Waterman
. . .or bobble a Teleport roll, eh?
You sent
But that’s what the Healers are in the games for.
You sent
“Oh, dzaq! Joe splinched right into a wall!”
John
Hehehe. They get to shine on tending to the (at times rather BIZARRE) injuries . . .physical AND psychic.
John
Here's a Character idea- made it all the way to the Games at Zhdant, but suffered some sort of horrible psychic injury that either eliminated or seriously reduced their Psi.
John
John Waterman
Or . . .got sacked for CHEATING!
You sent
Ooh, that’s a good way to spend the next year of your life having your brain rewired!
John
John Waterman
But you're still . . .USEFUL. One of the best of the best, if flawed. The Zhdantia do not dispose of anyone of use.
You sent
Given the importance of the Games, the security around them must be TIGHT.
John
John Waterman
Why? Let's think it over in their terms, not 3I ones.
You sent
Yeah, we need to consider how it all gets officiated.
You sent
It can’t be just any nobles; too much chance of outside influences. Probably Tavrchedl?
John
John Waterman
The Zhdantia don't consider 'shenanigans'; they aren't set up that way. And the contestants are the best of the best, filtered through many layers of selection to get there. They are the apotheosis of DZ culture. Peerless, pure, and perfect.
You sent
But someone impartial has to be involved in the judging, and they’d also spot chicanery.
John
There's no rancor in their competitiveness, no grudges, no harboring ill will, like in 3I or Terran competitions.
John
John Waterman
The judges judge to the standards of the event, not the character of the contestants.
You sent
Because the winner(s) get promoted to greater responsibility.
John
That character is almost unimpeachable, by the time they get to Zhdant . . .
John
John Waterman
. . .no one with any moral failings is supposed to get this far.
You sent
But ambition makes people do strange and even insane things…
You sent
The stakes are very high.
John
John Waterman
I'm sure that the upper levels of the Tavrchedl are on hand, then. But who polices the most powerful Psionicists in the whole DZ?
You sent
The psychological pressure must be intense.
John
John Waterman
Oh, no doubt.
You sent
The Grand Inquisitor.
John
John Waterman
Who themselves must have competed in these 'Games' once upon a time, eh?
You sent
It stands to reason that the ranks of the Tavrchedl include all levels of the upper strata; there’s at least one SOC-15 Tav in each sector charged with investigating the Princely-born.
You sent
No one is above Fevranzhtavr…
John
John Waterman
Everyone in the Supreme Council MUST have competed in the Games when young, and all did WELL there.
You sent
And the games are watched by the highest levels of Nobility, which includes the Tavrchedl…
You sent
Oh yeah.
John
It really is less of a sporting contest, and more a final selection process for the upper leadership of the DZ. First step up the ladder, as it were.
John
Not EVERY winner makes the Council- there are amny other rungs to climb- but NO ONE gets there eventually without placing 'Best In Game' . . .
John
John Waterman
. . .or is that too facile? Too one-dimensional?
You sent
Not necessarily. The Games are a very important selective structure.
You sent
I’m trying to find entries about the Games but the Kindle app SUCKS for searching on specific terms.
John
John Waterman
So it's a leadership selection process, and not a 'Game' at all as the 3I sees it.
You sent
Exactly.
You sent
As you said, we call it “games” because we have no other frame of reference.
John
John Waterman
Maybe 'Teqozdievl' has a very specific and archaic meaning . . .
You sent
Well… Teqozastial is Olympiad Day, Teqozdij is (loosely translated as) Olympiad, so Teqozdievl? We’ve never defined Teqoz…
John
John Waterman
Something along the lines of what we'd call a 'crucible' or 'forge'- a place where leaders are found, made and 'born'.
You sent
Or dij, for that matter…
You sent
I like that.
John
We don't have to use those Anglic calques- just riffing on the concept.
John
John Waterman
'The Choosing'- or 'The Making' . . .?
You sent
I’m ok with the actual meaning being lost in the sands of time…
John
Same here. I just want to inform our thinking about it in ways that don't include 'game', or even 'contest', though it is a competitive activity in some fashion.
John
Just how the competition plays out is fun to think about, but it's not the end result of the activity.
John
The end result is the selection / creation of each new 'cadre' group who will go on to lead the DZ, first at relatively low levels and later all the way to the Supreme Council itself.
John
Do the 'Games' focus on tradition, to bring forth people who will do the same old things the same old way and preserve the status quo?
John
Or do they have a component of adding new blood and new ideas from these fledgling leaders into the DZ's command and decision-making system?
John
John Waterman
Or both? Does the pendulum swing first one way, then the other, over time? All stuff we ought to posit for discussion.
You sent
Here’s where we need to consider their thinking about time as well. If the games are seen not as a “this year” event and more like a continuum of events linking past to future, then they’re seen also as how their society moves forward.
John
Oooooh, GOOD!
John
John Waterman
Who manages THAT, though?
You sent
No one; it just IS. Or rather, the events of the games become part of Fevranzh.
John
John Waterman
So how does the culture 'steer' itself towards new goals or to react to new threats?
You sent
Inevitably new strategies and tactics will appear in the Games (and smaller competitions) that get incorporated into the broader cultural thinking. 

Or not, if they’re seen as too dangerous…
John
John Waterman
We've already discussed the DZ's homoestatic mechanisms- the ways by which it preserves its internal stability over the millennia- but we've never explored how it reacts to new threats or finds ways to go in new directions.
John
John Waterman
So the 'Games'- through some process as yet undefined- pumps new blood, new ideas and new thinking into a cadre of new leaders, who then eventually rise to the upper levels of policy making and thus keep the DZ moving to counter new threats and follow new opportunities. Is that near the mark?
You sent
The Games are probably one way. They’re very traditional thinkers but they aren’t stagnant; ingenuity is rewarded under the right circumstances.
You sent
That’s just it.
You sent
‘Any Intendant may apply once during his or her lifetime to compete in the Thequzdievl (Psionic Games) by making a Psionic Strength check. If successful, the individual devotes that term of service to competition in the Thequzdievl instead of to career matters. ‘
John
John Waterman
I don't want to use the term 'Progress'- that's a Western European Terran concept that doesn't fit in with how the Zhdantia see the world or history.
You sent
The book goes on to say that characters should only be allowed to compete during generation - but what fun is that?
John
John Waterman
Right?
You sent
I think the real reason for that line is because at the time of writing, no one had actually spent the time to come up with what the games ARE…
John
That makes perfect sense.
John
John Waterman
Is that an earlier version of the name for the 'Games'?
You sent
…so you get one shot, and make two dice rolls against Psi to find out how well you did. 8+ on the first, 12+ on the second. Pass the first, and you get +1 Psi. Pass the second, and you get +1 Psi and +1 Soc.
You sent
It’s from the Mongoose book.
John
John Waterman
So the Chargen rules see the Games as a potential career advancer (in terms of increasing your Psi by training, and your Soc by placing somewhere in the contest).
You sent
You sent
From the original book:
John
John Waterman
Tough rolls, but a good payoff.
You sent
It’s a little more detailed, but not by much.
You sent
John
John Waterman
So lots of people are called to 'try out', probably at a local level; but only the best of the best of the best go to Zhdant.
You sent
It does, however, suggest building an adventure around the games…
You sent
I would imagine local and regional contests are encouraged.
You sent
It’s good for the individuals and for society.
John
John Waterman
. . .it also means that not only new Intendants can enter the contests, but 'older' and perhaps more experienced Psions can as well. Okay, this changes my thinking somewhat.
You sent
Yeah, you can have up-and-coming kids in the games alongside career artisans, soldiers, politicians, doctors, etc.
John
So, the 'Final Round' on Zhdant is fun window dressing- the real benefit to society is each Psion contestant taking time to train, then testing themselves in the competition; if successful, they gain Psi and Soc.
John
Okay, I had a weird view of the thing. I'm on track now.
John
John Waterman
I still see the Bigs on Zhdant being where the real cream of the crop end up, and where the Supreme Council may be looking at the cadre for future Council members . . .
You sent
That’s a good way of seeing it. Everything we thought we knew is wrong, part 6…
John
John Waterman
. . .kind of like the 'Soldier Of The Month' competitions each Battalion and higher formation in the Army held. Your Company CO nominated a troop for Soldier Of The Month, and all such from each Battalion went on a competitive board in front of the Sergeant Major. The winner was 'Soldier of the Month', gets a minor award and a 3-day pass, unless . . .
John
John Waterman
. . .the winning troop decides to go to Brigade Soldier of the Month ('Decides', ha!) where all winners of the BNs in the Brigade go before a board in front of the BDE Sgt Maj, etc etc. Slightly higher awards for winning THAT one- and you could conceivably end up going to the Soldier Of The Year competition in Washington at Army HQ.
You sent
What really helps with figuring this out is the understanding that it’s literally not a game. It’s an essential element of how they choose future LEADERS with the skill, charisma, intelligence, and new thinking to move their society forward.
You sent
It’s beyond important to them.
John
Winners of THAT one got another stripe and their choice of their next Unit assignment / School.
John
John Waterman
I knew a guy at DLI who got sent into the Russian program because he won Soldier Of The Year. Still had to pass the DLAB, which he did, no surprise.
You sent
I never got any of those kinds of awards… didn’t really try, but still…
John
John Waterman
. . .I never fell into THAT trap. No CO of mine would have EVER sent me to SOTM!
You sent
I was best at flying under the radar and quietly getting the job done. Hated the spotlight.
John
I was a competent soldier and even a fairly decent front-line leader, but I was also a burr under every Commander's saddle because I ran my mouth- and tended to be RIGHT more often than not. The Army DOESN'T reward that sort of person.
John
'You're sending WATERMAN to the E5 Promotion board?' Yes, fuck.' <sigh> 'We NEED more Sergeants . . .'
John
John Waterman
I was a dumbass for thinking that running my mouth- even if I was RIGHT- was ever going to make any difference at all. Sigh.
You sent
That never ends well.
You sent
Hung out with some complete strangers this afternoon and ended up evangelizing Traveller. One of the guys was a Niven fan too.
John
NICE! Always like how you spread the True Faith!
John
John Waterman
So, are we going to make a distinction between the 'regional' contests and shooting for the Big One on Zhdant?
You sent
I think we have to. It’s not so much a “weeding out” process, because even the regional contests build the skills needed for greater responsibilities.
John
John Waterman
Of course, it benefits the local structures to have regional contests.
You sent
Every contest has both a cooperative and competitive aspect,
You sent
You have to be able to lead and organize as well as rise above.
John
John Waterman
And it helps channel ambition among the upper class.
You sent
Exactly. The right kind of ambition gets rewarded.
You sent
As does innovation.
You sent
“Did you see what Carl did in last week’s teleportation football match? That was wicked, man!”
You sent
Carl, of course, proceeds to show his peers how to do whatever it was that he did, and everyone benefits. Football team goes on to win the Subsector Bowl.
John
I can see anyone who is showing ambition being 'channeled' into spending a term training for and competing in a regional contest, while truly bright lights may get sponsored through an ascending series of them in hopes they can go to the Big One on Zhdant.
John
John Waterman
The lower level ones will separate the sheep from the goats, while sending someone to the Big One can only reflect well on the sponsor . . .
You sent
It’s possible, though only the Teqozdievl allow one to devote that kind of time exclusively to training.
John
John Waterman
The 'Teqozdievl' being the Big One on Zhdant, or any 'regional' contest as well?
You sent
Everyone else has to train in their personal time…
You sent
I think to maintain continuity with canon, Teqozdievl refers specifically to the Big Game.
You sent
Tradition, too.
John
John Waterman
Oh, OK. I was a little fuzzy on that. The rules you showed me seem to make it a DZ-wide phenomenon, meaning regional contests as well as the Teqozdievl . . .
You sent
It is, but I think they meant The Games to be specifically those held on Zhdant.
John
So the local contests are amateur league, train on your own time . . . but the Teqozdievl is the Big League, where you get supported and sponsored to take full time to train?
John
John Waterman
'The Olympics'.
You sent
Right.
You sent
When you compete in the Teqozdievl, you ONLY do that for one term.
You sent
No survival checks, but also no promotion (yet) and no new skills.
You sent
I’m trying to find out more but one of my PSF copies isn’t searchable…
You sent
Ok, found it. The Teqozdievl happens every Teqozdij, on Teqozastial. Every third Teqozdij there’s an extra day added to the festival to synchronize the calendar and extend the games for that year - the Atlteqozastial.
You sent
One can imagine THOSE games are particularly prestigious and well-attended!
You sent
The difference between this and the Olympics, of course, is that the winner(s) don’t end up hocking their medals to pay the rent…
John
Could make the difference in your prospects of future leadership . . .
John
John Waterman
. . .still unsure of how you get selected from all of the BILLIONS of Psions in the DZ to attend the Bigs.
You sent
That’s the big question.
You sent
Why does the noble patron choose one but not the other?
John
John Waterman
So . . .are there still regionals, or is all they do just the Teqozdievl on Zhdant?
You sent
Or none, sometimes?
You sent
There must be; they need some way of building up future leaders.
You sent
They do enjoy athletic competitions, like any other human society.
You sent
Theirs serve an actual purpose, unlike ours, which are just bread and circuses.
John
John Waterman
Foot races, other displays of personal prowess and skill. Team sports?
You sent
All of the above.
You sent
Psionics are forbidden in physical contests.
John
John Waterman
But no professional leagues. All amateur. How much competition, though?
John
John Waterman
I need other examples of sports from outside the 'Western' paradigm. I know how our sports evolved, individual and team, from mock battles waged during religious and funereal festivals in Antiquity and contests of skills among the Celts & Greeks et al . . .but nothing about how such activities developed away from the 'west', like in Asia, Africa, the Americas.
John
John Waterman
I do know of lacrosse and chunkey in pre-C North America, but that's about it.
You sent
I know next to nothing about non-western sports…
You sent
Sumo in Japan, but that’s about it…
You sent
Team sports? No idea.
John
Chariot racing in Rome and later Byzantium wound up being such important publicly-viewed contests that huge sums of money changed hands, and the teams- and who followed them- were politically important.
John
John Waterman
The chariot racetrack in Rome is a few centuries older than the Flavian Amphitheater.
John
John Waterman
We want the Zhdantia to be like us- to be human like us- enough that we'd like them to just enjoy simple sports as we supposedly do . . . but as in anything else in our culture, our very concept of sports and contests and competition is colored by the way our society resolves conflict and maintains social order . . .
You sent
That’s going to change everything about how their games work…
John
John Waterman
I think the Teqozdievl never had anything to do with contests themselves; I lean towards it being instituted solely to select the most useful and innovative Psions available for tasks in government, the military, and to serve the Nobles in their endeavors. Probably the latter at first.
John
John Waterman
The power of the early post-Dzaqtlas Noble Houses relied heavily on having the most capable Psions they could find, and engaging them in contests with one another the most efficient way to 'train the force' and also select the best from among them for particular service to the House.
John
John Waterman
Soon, each Noble House might send out its 'champions' to duel informally and then more formally- whether in 'battle' or just contests of skills- as a way to settle disputes without mobilizing expensive troops.
John
John Waterman
These practices would eventually come together as the Zhdantia established a world-wide government, into a contest to train up and then rate and select the best in each Discipline to best serve the State. The Noble Houses still exist, and it is they who sponsor the best Psions in each to engage in the Teqozdievl.


How much mental and physical peril are acceptable in the games?
The most useful talents in Zhdantia society are the ones that influence the public mindset and mental health
What about culturally Zhodani Vargr? How do they participate in the Teqozdievl? 
- species doesn't matter as much as we think
- accommodations would already be made to account for homeworld of origin - heavy gravity, light grav, etc.
-
