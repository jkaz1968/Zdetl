The Zdetl entry in the Traveller Wiki defines the following verb aspects constructed as a seperate word following the verb:
Daz - past
Chtenzh - future
Tsench - repetitive/habitual
Toz - punctual/completive
Pri' - hopeful/optative
-enzh - present participle (is -ing)
-ej - past perfect (has -ed)
These can be constructed as follows:
chtenzenzh - will be doing ___
tozenzh - will have been doing ___ (I did it, but it's finished now)
dazenzh - had been doing ___ (I was doing whatever)
dazej - had done
chtenzej - will have done
tozej - had finished
pri'enzh - hope to do
pri'ej - wish to have done/hope to have done
In Beginning Zdetl, I define another aspect, the conditional, using the atomic word "ek" meaning "if." However, it can also be combined with the participle and perfective suffixes to produce conditional aspects:
Ekenzh - ____ could possibly happen, if conditions are met
Ekej - ____ could have happened, if conditions had been met
As usual, these constructions follow the verb:
Zarish ekenzh - we could be travelling (if some condition is met)
Zarish ekej - we could have travelled (implying the condition was NOT met)

When used in combination with the verb infinitive, it implies "maybe" or "perhaps," as in:
Kochie, zdeze ekenzh (To sleep, perchance to dream)
