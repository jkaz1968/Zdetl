Canids on Zhdant

"Canid" - FEQRODA
Zhdant has few pack predators, due to the lack of large herbivore prey animals. Most of what would be considered "canids" are analogous to Terran foxes, coyotes and other hunters, either solitary or living in small communities of a single family unit. They are found in nearly every biome except the deep deserts of Dleqiats and are most common on Qiknavra and the western forests of Dleqiats.
Though they are mainly meat-eaters, few are obligate carnivores, and are capable of getting nutrition from a variety of sources. 
Found in most biomes other than the deep desert
Analogues to foxes and coyotes, solitary or very small groups especially in desert and savanna regions
Most common on the continent of Qiknavra and western Dleqiats
