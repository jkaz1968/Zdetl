Scene: Three children are playing in the field, levitating various objects including balls and a hoop. Kieko approaches them cautiously with Obrenstebr. Obrenstebr introduces Kieko to the children.
The children pause their play.

Obrenstebr: Children, this is Kieko, our new dlenchiepr-child.

Aiaplor - Hello Kieko!

Niria'lients - Are you a telekinetic?

Obrenstebr - Yes, Kieko is telekinetic. She will join you in your training from now on.

Prezbra - She will do well. Kieko watch for the ball.

Kieko - What ball? (She ducks as a ball flies over her head)

Prezbra - That ball. It is good to meet you.

Obrenstebr - Please join the children and play, Kieko. I must speak with your dlenchiepr-mothers.

Kieko - Thank you, Obrenstebr. Aiaplor, what are we playing?

Aiaplor - Levitation and throwing! One of us levitates a ball and the others try to hit it telekinetically.

Niria'lients - Try it, it's fun! I'll go next. (He concentrates and the largest ball floats upward) Now, move a ball telekinetically and try to make it hit mine.

Kieko - Ok... (she concentrates and a ball begins to float. Slowly it moves toward the larger ball.)

Prezbra - It's going to fall.

Aiaplor - Quiet, Prezbra. (To Kieko) He thinks he's a precognitive.

(Kieko's ball gets close to the larger ball, then falls)

Kieko - it's too far away!

Niria'lients - Don't worry, you'll get better at it. We practice every day. Want to try again?

Kieko - Yes, please!
